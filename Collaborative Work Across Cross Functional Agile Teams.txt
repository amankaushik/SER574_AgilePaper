  The article discussed that the key to making agile work across a network of teams if to infuse ‘the agile way’ into the system from the ground up. Each paragraph has clear topic sentence and stick to one main idea. It’s overall structure is very clear and arrange in logical sequence. From certain degree, it’s a good article. However, there are still some little problems.
  Team structures, communication, clear goals and tools used are all important factors across agile team works. It had better too combine it or the papers looks very unorganized. Also, it’s obviously that its reference order is undisciplined and overall size exceed two pages. Most importantly, the article depict well about importance of architecture instead of relationship with design.
  Therefore, this article is ok to accept weakly and it still has some space to edit and improve. Here, I give some advice as bellow:
  
  1. Remove the blank space between “Introduction” and “Team Structure”.
  2. Citation order face some problems, it should edit the reference order in “Reference”.
  3. Too much citation in “Introduction” part, it had better remove some and add more personal understanding, just advice.
  4. Narrow down the parts, for example, combine part 3, 4, 5, 6 as a big topic, like important factors to collaboration across agile team works.
  5. The article can remove some unnecessary parts to let article not exceed two pages.For example, you can just write some issue with successfully managing a network of cross-functional agile teams more simple in your own words to save the space.
  6. The article emphasize the importance of architecture, instead of pay little attention on relationship between architecture and design. It can enrich this part.
  7. As it’s a short article, it has too much citation. It’s better to remove some citation and replace with your own understanding.
  8. In the reference part, it doesn’t follow same format. It should better add name and article title in reference.
